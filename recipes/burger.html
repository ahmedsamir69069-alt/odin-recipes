        <h1>Triple Seared Whiskey Burger</h1>
        <p>This triple-seared whiskey burger uses the technique from my Japanese-style triple seared steak, and produces the most extraordinarily delicious, juicy burger, with a whiskey-soy glazed exterior.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>

            <li>1 pound ground beef (85% lean recommended)</li>
            <br>

            <li>2 teaspoons avocado oil</li>
            <br>

            <li>2 tablespoons sea salt</li>
            <br>

            <li>1/3 cup whiskey</li>
            <br>

            <li>1/4 cup soy sauce</li>
            <br>

        </ul>
        <br>
        <h2>Driection</h2>
            <h3>Step 1</h3>
                <p>Wet your hands, and form 2 (8-ounce) burgers; place on a plate, cover, and refrigerate until ready to grill. For this process, cold meat works best. </p>
                <br>
            <h3>Step 2</h3>
                <p> Before starting the triple-searing process, build a very hot hardwood charcoal fire. Oak, mesquite or hickory are great choices. The coals should be glowing red, and radiating extreme heat before the meat hits the grill. </p>
                <br>
            <h3>Step 3</h3>
                <p>Rub burgers all over with oil. Coat with sea salt until entire surface area is completely covered. </p>
                <br>
            <h3>Step 4</h3>
                <p>Pour whiskey into a shallow bowl; set aside. </p>
                <br>
            <h3>Step 5</h3>
                <p> Place burgers on hottest spot on the grill, and sear both sides, 2 minutes per side. </p>
                <br>
            <h3>Step 6</h3>                
                <p> Transfer burgers into bowl of whiskey, and turn constantly for at least 1 minute. Most of the salt will rinse off. </p>
                <br>
            <h3>Step 7</h3>
                <p>Place burgers back onto the hottest spot on the grill, and sear both sides again, 2 minutes per side. You can baste steak with a small amount of whiskey while searing. </p>
                <br>
            <h3>Step 8</h3>
                <p>Add soy sauce to another shallow bowl. Add burgers to the bowl, and turn constantly for at least 1 minute. </p>
                <br>
            <h3>Step 9</h3>
                <p> Return burgers to the hottest spot on the grill for the 3rd and final sear. Grill each side until desired doneness is reached, about 2 minutes. For a rosy-pink (medium-rare) inside, remove when an instant-read thermometer inserted near the center reads 125 to 130 F (52 to 54 degrees C). </p>
